#Extract Apple Health Data

At present, we are extracting Apple Health data manually.

The process is as follows:

1. Open the Apple Health app on the user's iPhone.
2. Click on the user icon in the top right corner.
3. Click on "Export All Health Data."
4. Confirm that you want to export all data by selecting "Export."
5. Export to the user's Mac.

## To Do

It is theoretically possible to extract the data automatically using Shortcuts. However, the shortcuts documentation is limited, and to date all attempts have failed.
